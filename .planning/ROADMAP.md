### Phase Details

#### Phase 14: Theory Foundation
**Goal:** music21 is installed, importable, and wrapped in a theory library that converts between music21 objects and MCP-friendly JSON. The module structure is established for all subsequent phases.

**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 14-01-PLAN.md — Install music21 dependency, create theory/ package with pitch mapping utilities
- [x] 14-02-PLAN.md — Wire MCP tools, register with FastMCP, create comprehensive test suite

**Delivers:**
- `music21` in MCP_Server dependencies (pyproject.toml / requirements.txt)
- `MCP_Server/theory/` package with core utilities (pitch mapping, chord builder, scale utils)
- `MCP_Server/tools/theory.py` tool module registered with FastMCP
- Bidirectional MIDI ↔ note name conversion verified against Ableton's pitch range
- Test infrastructure for theory tools

**Requirements:** THRY-01, THRY-02, THRY-03

#### Phase 15: Chord Engine
**Goal:** Claude can build any chord by name, get inversions and voicings, identify chords from pitches, and enumerate all diatonic chords in a key.

**Plans:** 1/2 plans executed

Plans:
- [x] 15-01-PLAN.md — Chord library with all 5 functions (build, inversions, voicings, identify, diatonic) and unit tests
- [ ] 15-02-PLAN.md — Wire 5 MCP chord tools, update barrel exports, add integration tests

**Delivers:**
- `build_chord` tool — root + quality → MIDI pitches
- `get_chord_inversions` tool — all inversions of a chord
- `get_chord_voicings` tool — close/open/drop-2/drop-3 voicings
- `identify_chord` tool — MIDI pitches → chord name + quality
- `get_diatonic_chords` tool — key → all triads and 7th chords with Roman numerals

**Requirements:** CHRD-01, CHRD-02, CHRD-03, CHRD-04, CHRD-05

#### Phase 16: Scale & Mode Explorer
**Goal:** Claude can explore all available scales/modes, generate pitch sets for composition, validate notes against scales, and discover related tonalities.

**Delivers:**
- `list_scales` tool — all available scales/modes with intervals
- `get_scale_pitches` tool — root + scale + octave range → MIDI pitches
- `check_notes_in_scale` tool — validate pitches against a scale
- `get_related_scales` tool — parallel, relative, and modal relationships
- `detect_scales_from_notes` tool — find scales containing given pitches

**Requirements:** SCLE-01, SCLE-02, SCLE-03, SCLE-04, SCLE-05

#### Phase 17: Progression Engine
**Goal:** Claude can retrieve genre-specific progressions, generate voice-led chord sequences, analyze existing progressions as Roman numerals, and get next-chord suggestions.

**Delivers:**
- `get_common_progressions` tool — genre/style → progression templates with MIDI output
- `generate_progression` tool — key + Roman numerals → voice-led MIDI chords
- `analyze_progression` tool — chord sequence → Roman numeral analysis
- `suggest_next_chord` tool — context-aware chord suggestion

**Requirements:** PROG-01, PROG-02, PROG-03, PROG-04

#### Phase 18: Harmonic Analysis
**Goal:** Claude can analyze existing clip content — detecting the key, identifying chords at each time position, and understanding the harmonic rhythm.

**Delivers:**
- `detect_key` tool — MIDI notes → detected key with confidence score
- `analyze_clip_chords` tool — time-segmented chord identification
- `analyze_harmonic_rhythm` tool — chord change frequency, durations, structure

**Requirements:** ANLY-01, ANLY-02, ANLY-03
**Note:** These tools accept note data as input (from `get_notes` output), not clip references directly. The AI reads the clip first, then passes notes to analysis.

#### Phase 19: Voice Leading & Rhythm
**Goal:** Claude can connect chords with smooth voice leading and apply rhythm patterns to turn chord progressions into playable MIDI note sequences.

**Delivers:**
- `voice_lead_chords` tool — connect two chords with minimal movement
- `voice_lead_progression` tool — full progression with voice leading applied
- `get_rhythm_patterns` tool — style-based rhythm templates (arpeggio, bass, comping)
- `apply_rhythm_pattern` tool — pattern + chords → time-positioned MIDI notes

**Requirements:** VOIC-01, VOIC-02, RHYM-01, RHYM-02
