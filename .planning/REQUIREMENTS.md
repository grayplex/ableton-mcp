# Requirements: AbletonMCP

**Defined:** 2026-03-10
**Core Value:** An AI assistant can produce actual music in Ableton — instruments load, notes play, effects shape sound, and the mix comes together.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Foundation

- [x] **FNDN-01**: Server runs on Python 3 only — all Python 2 compatibility code removed
- [x] **FNDN-02**: Remote Script uses Python 3.11 idioms (super(), f-strings, type hints, queue module)
- [x] **FNDN-03**: Socket protocol uses length-prefix framing instead of JSON-completeness parsing
- [x] **FNDN-04**: Global connection protected by threading.Lock for concurrent tool invocations
- [x] **FNDN-05**: All error handling uses specific exception types — no bare except:pass blocks
- [x] **FNDN-06**: Remote Script command dispatch uses dict-based router instead of if/elif chain
- [x] **FNDN-07**: MCP tools organized into domain modules (tracks, clips, mixing, etc.)
- [x] **FNDN-08**: Remote Script handlers organized into domain modules with @main_thread decorator
- [x] **FNDN-09**: Linting configured with ruff (target Python 3.11, PEP 8, import ordering)
- [x] **FNDN-10**: Test infrastructure with pytest + pytest-asyncio using FastMCP in-memory client

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Audio export / render | Live Python API does not expose export functions; only brittle GUI automation possible |
| Real-time audio input processing | MCP latency (100ms-1s) makes this impractical; requires hardware config |
| MIDI 2.0 features | Python Remote Script API does not expose MIDI 2.0 properties |
| Video features | Ableton's video support is minimal and not exposed in Python API |
| Max for Live device creation | Separate domain requiring Max/MSP knowledge; can load M4L devices but not create them |
| Parameter listeners / real-time push | Socket protocol is request-response; listeners need different architecture |
| Direct .als file manipulation | Undocumented gzip'd XML format; risks corrupting projects |
| Multi-session management | Socket server is one-to-one; port-per-instance adds complexity for edge-case benefit |
