# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-10)

**Core value:** An AI assistant can produce actual music in Ableton — instruments load, notes play, effects shape sound, and the mix comes together.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation Repair

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Foundation Repair)
Plan: 0 of 4 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-10 — Roadmap created, all 53 v1 requirements mapped to 10 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Extend existing codebase rather than rebuild — architecture is sound
- [Roadmap]: Python 3 only, strip all Py2 compat — Ableton Live 12 = Python 3.11
- [Roadmap]: Fine granularity selected — 10 phases to let natural domain boundaries stand

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Instrument loading fix requires same-callback selected_track + load_item + device count verification — race condition is documented, fix is known
- [Phase 9]: Automation envelopes require understanding Session vs Arrangement envelope distinction — may need research spike during Phase 9 planning
- [Phase 10]: Input/output routing APIs vary by track type and hardware — needs testing against actual Ableton instance before implementation

## Session Continuity
